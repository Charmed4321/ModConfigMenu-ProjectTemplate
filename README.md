# ModConfigMenu-ProjectTemplate

Put this together to save myself some time. This is a project template that has the ModConfigMenuAPI files included and a simple setup for a mod config menu with a little commenting to help.

>1. Make a zip file from the MCMDefaultMod folder of this project. There is a pre-made zip on the top level, but it's not the latest version.

>2. Place it in <steamapps>\common\XCOM 2 War of the Chosen SDK\Binaries\Win32\ModBuddy\Extensions\Application\ProjectTemplates\XCOM2Mod\1033\

>3. Delete %LOCALAPPDATA%\Firaxis\XCOM_ModBuddy_WarOfTheChosen\2013\VTC\SOME_THING~PC\ProjectTemplates

> 4. Start ModBuddy again
